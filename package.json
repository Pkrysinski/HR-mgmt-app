  "description": "The purpose of our app is to demonstrate our knowledge of NodeJS, OOP (Object Oriented Porogramming), and applying those concepts towards making a web application.  The application will act as a basic HR (Human Resources) management software which can help track current employees on a theoretical team.  The app will take in information about employees on a software development team via a NodeJS app, and then generate an HTML file with summaries for each employee with information based on submitted text. There will be 3 types of personnel that can be entered; Manager, Engineer, and Intern.  Depending on the position being submitted will send different questions to the user to answer about the individual being entered.",
